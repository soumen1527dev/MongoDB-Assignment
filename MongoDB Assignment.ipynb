    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "# MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "# Ans :\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB :- MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system (DBMS) that is designed to store, retrieve,\n",
    "# and manage data in a flexible and scalable way. MongoDB falls into the category of NoSQL databases, which \n",
    "# means it does not use traditional SQL (Structured Query Language) for data manipulation and retrieval, but\n",
    "# instead employs a document-oriented data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Non-relational database :- Non-relational databases, often referred to as NoSQL databases, are a category \n",
    "# of database management systems designed to store and retrieve data in a way that differs from traditional \n",
    "# relational databases. Here are some key characteristics of non-relational databases in a nutshell:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Flexible Data Models: Non-relational databases allow for flexible data modeling, making it easier\n",
    "# to store semi-structured or unstructured data. Data can be stored in various formats, such as documents, \n",
    "# key-value pairs, column-family, or graph structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.No Fixed Schema: Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases do not enforce a fixed schema for data. \n",
    "# This means that different records within the same database can have different structures, making them \n",
    "# suitable for scenarios where data schemas evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.Scalability: Many NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, allowing you to distribute data\n",
    "# across multiple servers or nodes. This enables them to handle large volumes of data and high-velocity workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.High Availability: Non-relational databases often provide features like replication and sharding \n",
    "# to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.Querying: NoSQL databases typically offer their own query languages or APIs for data retrieval and manipulation. \n",
    "# These languages are often designed to handle specific types of data models efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.Use Cases: Non-relational databases are commonly used for web and mobile applications, real-time analytics, \n",
    "# content management systems, IoT (Internet of Things) applications, and scenarios where rapid development and scaling are priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why mongoDB is preferred over sql :-\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in specific scenarios where its features and characteristics align with the\n",
    "# requirements of the application. Here are some common scenarios in which MongoDB is a preferred choice:\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 1.Flexible Schema and Data Models: When your data is semi-structured or unstructured, and you need the flexibility \n",
    "# to evolve the schema over time without a rigid predefined structure, MongoDB's document-oriented data \n",
    "# model is advantageous. This is useful for applications where data may change frequently or have varying attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Scalability: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability. If your application anticipates rapid data growth\n",
    "# and you need to distribute data across multiple servers or clusters, MongoDB's sharding capabilities make it a \n",
    "# good choice. It can handle large volumes of data and high-velocity workloads, making it suitable for scaling web and mobile applications.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 3.Real-Time Analytics and Logging: In scenarios where you require real-time data analytics or logging, MongoDB's ability to\n",
    "# store and retrieve data quickly can be beneficial. Its support for indexing and aggregation pipelines helps in performing\n",
    "# complex queries and aggregations efficiently.    \n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.Content Management Systems (CMS): MongoDB is often used in content management systems where content items have varying\n",
    "# structures or metadata. It allows for flexible content storage, making it easier to manage diverse types of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.Internet of Things (IoT) Applications: IoT generates a vast amount of data from various sources with different formats.\n",
    "# MongoDB's ability to store sensor data, device logs, and related information in a flexible way is advantageous for IoT applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.Prototyping and Rapid Development: MongoDB is suitable for prototyping and rapid application development due to its lack \n",
    "# of a fixed schema. Developers can iterate quickly without needing to update a rigid database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.Geospatial Data: If your application involves geospatial data like location-based services or mapping, MongoDB has \n",
    "# robust support for geospatial indexing and queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8.Document Management: Applications that require document management, such as file storage and retrieval, \n",
    "# can benefit from MongoDB's document storage capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9.Social Media and User-Generated Content: For platforms that handle user-generated content with varying \n",
    "# attributes and formats, MongoDB's flexibility is advantageous.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10.Caching and Session Management: MongoDB can be used as a caching layer or for session management due to its fast read and write operations."

    "# Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "# Ans :\n",
    "    \n",
    "# MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. It offers a variety of\n",
    "# features that make it suitable for a wide range of applications. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB, along with explanations:\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 1.Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, semi-structured documents called BSON (Binary JSON). This document-oriented approach \n",
    "# allows for the storage of data with varying structures within the same collection (similar to a table in SQL databases).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.No Schema Constraints: Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB does not enforce a rigid schema on the data. You can store\n",
    "# documents with different fields and data types in the same collection, providing greater flexibility for evolving data structures.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 3.Dynamic Schema: MongoDB's dynamic schema allows you to add or remove fields from documents as needed, making it well-suited \n",
    "# for applications where data schemas change frequently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.Scalability: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, allowing you to distribute data across multiple servers or clusters.\n",
    "# It supports automatic sharding, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data and high-velocity workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.High Availability: MongoDB provides features for ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. It supports replica sets,\n",
    "# which maintain multiple copies of data across different servers, and automatic failover in case of server failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.Powerful Query Language: MongoDB offers a flexible and powerful query language for searching and retrieving data. \n",
    "# Queries are expressed in JSON-like syntax and can handle complex filtering, sorting, and aggregation operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.Indexes: MongoDB supports the creation of indexes on fields within documents to improve query performance. \n",
    "# You can create single-field indexes, compound indexes, and geospatial indexes to optimize queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8.Geospatial Queries: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data and allows for geospatial indexing\n",
    "# and queries. This is valuable for applications that involve location-based services or mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9.Community and Support: MongoDB has a large and active community, extensive documentation, and commercial support options for enterprise users.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10.Security: MongoDB offers security features such as authentication, authorization, role-based access control, and encryption to protect your data."
